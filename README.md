github.io

homework attempt 3
Hey Keith,

Great to catch up today. Enjoy the holiday!

Just to reiterate the challenge I set with Github, here's the idea:

- Create a basic HTML index file
- Create a new Github repo, named yarrumk.github.io
- Follow the instructions for making your local test project a git repo
(git init, git add remote ..., git add index.html, git commit -a -m "First commit", git push -u origin)
- Create a new branch called gh-pages (git checkout -b gh-pages)
- Git commit -am "New pages branch"
- git push origin gh-pages

This should then result in your yarrumk.github.io repo having both a master and a gh-pages branch. It may take up to 10 minutes but then you'll have something at the url http://yarrumk.github.io.

This is from the top of my head so forgive any errors, should be close enough though. Any questions, ask away :)
